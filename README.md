### Details on not-so-good practices

1. Absence of TypeScript
   - TypeScript enhances proactive software development.
2. Lack of Linting
   - No JavaScript linting to check for eventual errors.
   - No tailwind linting to check for potential errors and non-standard structures.
3. Bad naming
   - Poorly named variables and functions contribute to code confusion.
4. Bad Structure
5. Bad structuring of data array / bad array naming
   - Unnecessary array naming and structuring complicate code readability.
6. Mental mapping
   - Reliance on shorthand variable names may be clear during development but leads to confusion later.
7. Client sided "page.tsx"
8. Functions Lack Descriptive Naming
9. Code Duplication
10. Working in main branch at all times.
11. Bad commit names.
